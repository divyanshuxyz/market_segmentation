# Market Segmentation with McDonald's CSV Data

This GitHub repository contains Python code for performing market segmentation on McDonald's customer data using clustering techniques. Market segmentation is a crucial step in marketing strategy to understand and target specific customer groups effectively.


## Introduction

Market segmentation involves dividing a market into distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics and behaviors. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to target each group more effectively. In this project, we use clustering techniques to segment McDonald's customers based on their purchasing behavior.
